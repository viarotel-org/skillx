# Stitch Designer (Master Skill)

This is the entry point for all UI design tasks. It acts as the **"Orchestrator Agent"** that autonomously plans and executes the design workflow.

## When to use this skill

**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE:**
**You must ONLY use this skill when the user EXPLICITLY mentions "Stitch" in their request.**

**Use this skill when:**
- The user asks to "Design a UI", "Create a screen", "Make an app page" **using Stitch**.
- The user provides a high-level design request (e.g., "I need a dashboard for my SaaS") **and mentions Stitch**.

**Trigger phrases include:**
- "Use Stitch to design..."
- "Stitch me a UI for..."

## Workflow (Flow-first, copy-pastable)

This skill must follow this workflow end-to-end. Do not skip steps.

### 0) Preflight (Tool Availability)

1. Detect whether Stitch MCP tools are available.
2. If tools are available, follow the **Execution workflow**.
3. If tools are not available, follow the **Prompt-only workflow**.

### 1) Intent Classification

Determine the task type:

- **New screen**: design + generate a new UI screen.
- **Refine / Beautify**: modify an existing screen while preserving layout and information architecture.

### 2) Design Spec Workflow (Brain)

Invoke `stitch-ui-design-spec-generator` with the user request.

Expected result:

- A structured `Design Spec` JSON (Theme, Device, Style, Mode).

### 3) Contract Workflow (Hard Constraints)

If the request includes a named design system / style, fetch constraints from the matching design contract tool and inject them into the final prompt.

Supported mapping (Match Priority: Specific > General):

- `uview-pro`, `uviewpro`, `uview pro` -> use `stitch-ui-design-spec-uviewpro` (Match this FIRST)
- `uview`, `uview2`, `uview2.0`, `u-view` -> use `stitch-ui-design-spec-uview`
- `layui`, `layui-vue`, `layui vue` -> use `stitch-ui-design-spec-layui`
- `bootstrap`, `bootstrap-vue`, `bs-vue` -> use `stitch-ui-design-spec-bootstrap`
- `element`, `element-plus`, `el-plus`, `element-ui` -> use `stitch-ui-design-spec-element-plus`
- `vant`, `vant4`, `vant-ui` -> use `stitch-ui-design-spec-vant`

Decision rules:

- If the user asks for refine/beautify, or explicitly asks for selector / JSON / `contracts.include` / `states.include`:
  - Use `stitch-ui-design-spec-uview` or `stitch-ui-design-spec-layui` in **selector mode**.
  - Treat the returned selection JSON as internal and use the assembled prompt as the execution prompt.
- Otherwise:
  - Use `stitch-ui-design-spec-uview` or `stitch-ui-design-spec-layui` in **prefix mode**.
  - Prepend the returned prefix to `[Context]`.

### 4) Prompt Assembly Workflow (Pen)

Invoke `stitch-ui-prompt-architect` with the user request and (if any) Design Spec + contract prefix. The output must conform to **Prompt Quality Standard: Optimized Prompt Structure** (see below) so that Stitch receives a precise "construction blueprint" rather than a vague idea.

**Minimum structure** (always present):

```text
[Context]
...

[Layout]
...

[Components]
...
```

**When the request describes an app or multi-section screen**, the assembled prompt MUST additionally follow the **Optimized Prompt Structure** (inspired by enhance-prompt best practice: Project Overview + Design System (required) + Page Structure and Function). See section **Prompt Quality Standard** below.

### 5) Execution Workflow (Hand) — Tools Available

ALWAYS execute immediately (no confirmation loop):

1. Create project: `create_project`
2. Generate screen: `generate_screen_from_text`
3. List screens: `list_screens`
4. Get the target screen: `get_screen` (export screenshot + HTML assets)

### 6) Prompt-only Workflow — Tools Not Available

STOP execution. Do not fake results. Output only a copy-paste prompt for the user to run in Stitch.

## Output Patterns (Strict Templates)

Use these templates to keep outputs consistent.

### Template A — Tools Available (Execution Report)

ALWAYS use this exact template:

```markdown
# Stitch Design Delivery

## Execution Result
- Project: projects/{id}
- Screen: {screenId}

## Asset Export
- Screenshot: {from get_screen output}
- HTML: {from get_screen output}

## Notes
- Prompt: Executed with `[Context] [Layout] [Components]` structure (including required constraints and layout invariants).
```

### Template B — Tools Not Available (Prompt Only)

ALWAYS use this exact template. When the request is app/product-level or multi-section, the **content** inside each section must follow the **Optimized Prompt Structure** (Project overview in Context; Design system (required) in Context or a dedicated block; Page structure and function with core function + areas in Layout/Components).

```text
[Context]
...

[Layout]
...

[Components]
...
```

## Prompt Quality Standard: Optimized Prompt Structure

To make Stitch **accurately** implement the design, the final prompt (from step 4) must be a **detailed construction blueprint**, not a short wishlist. Use the following structure whenever the user describes an app, a product, or a screen with multiple sections.

**Source of truth**: This structure is derived from the optimized-prompt pattern: a clear **project overview**, a **design system (required)** with explicit tokens, and **page structure and function** with one **core function** per page/section plus **area-level details** (top nav, main visual, function area, actions, bottom). Reference: blog "Trae+Stitch MCP+Skills: My New AI Programming Paradigm" — after optimization it becomes a detailed construction blueprint including color scheme, font sizes, button styles, page layout, and UX.

### 1) Project Overview — Required for app/product-level requests

- One short paragraph: **what** the product/screen is, **who** it is for, **style** (e.g. modern minimal, professional and trustworthy, bright and fresh), and **key attributes** (ease of use, information readability, full localized UI, etc.).
- Example: "An AI ingredient-list analysis tool for end users, turning chemical terms into plain language via image recognition and composition parsing. Modern minimal design, emphasis on ease of use and readability, full localized interface."

### 2) Design System — Required

The prompt MUST include an explicit design system block so Stitch does not guess colors, type, or components. Include:

| Block | Content | Example |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Platform** | Web / Mobile / Desktop, target device or width | "Mobile miniapp, prioritize iOS and Android" / "Admin Web, min width 1280px" |
| **Theme** | Mood + domain affinity | "Bright and fresh, professional and trustworthy, with domain-friendly tone" |
| **Color scheme** | Primary + Secondary + Warning + Neutrals (Background, Text, Secondary text, Divider), each with **#hex** and usage | Primary #165DFF for buttons/nav; Secondary #36D399 for positive cues; Background #FFFFFF; Text #1D2129; Secondary text #86909C; Divider #F2F3F5 |
| **Typography** | Title / Body / Auxiliary: **size (px)** + **font** + **weight** | Title 20px Bold; Body 16px Regular; Auxiliary 14px Light |
| **Component style** | Buttons / Cards / Icons: radius, shadow, interaction | Buttons 8px radius, soft shadow; Cards 12px radius, light shadow; Icons linear, minimal |

If a **named design system** (uView Pro, Bootstrap, Element Plus, etc.) is used, the contract prefix from step 3 already supplies tokens; the assembled prompt must still state **Platform**, **Theme**, and **Layout invariants** in human-readable form so Stitch understands intent.

### 3) Page Structure and Function

For **each** page or major section:

- **Core function**: One line — "This page/section is for... so that..."
- **Areas** (choose as needed): **Top nav** / **Hero / main visual** / **Function area** / **Action area** / **Footer** / **Sidebar**.
- Under each area: **concrete elements** (e.g. "Brand logo + Help entry", "Primary CTA 'Scan label' large filled", "Secondary 'Choose from gallery' outline"). Use specific copy and roles (primary button, secondary button, card, list item) instead of "a button" or "some text".

**Example (single section):**

```text
### 1. Home (Scan / Upload)
**Core function**: App entry, guide user to start
- **Top nav**: Brand logo + Help entry
- **Hero**: Headline "Ingredient Translator" + subhead "Understand food labels at a glance"
- **Function area**: Primary button "Scan label" (large, primary fill); Secondary "Choose from gallery" (outline, primary border); short usage copy
- **Footer**: Privacy and terms links
```

### 4) Prompt Structure Checklist (before calling generate_screen_from_text)

Verify (and if missing, request the prompt-architect to add):

- [ ] **Project overview** present for app/product-level requests? (one paragraph: what, who, style, key attributes)
- [ ] **Design system (required)** present? Platform, Theme, **Color scheme with #hex**, **Typography (px + font + weight)**, **Component style** (buttons, cards, icons)
- [ ] **Per-page/section**: **Core function** one line + **areas** (top nav / hero / function / action / footer) with **concrete elements** and specific copy?
- [ ] **Layout** and **Components** sections still populated? (macro layout + component list)
- [ ] No vague placeholders? ("a button" → "primary CTA button 'Sign In'"; "some list" → "vertical list of Workout Cards with thumbnail, duration, Start button")

If any of the above is missing, **re-invoke** `stitch-ui-prompt-architect` with explicit instructions to fill the Optimized Prompt Structure (project overview, design system with hex/px, page structure with core function and area-level details), then re-run the checklist before execution.

## Anti-Patterns (Strict Prohibitions)
*   ⛔ **NO FAKE SUCCESS**: If you didn't get a real API response, do not say "Project Created".
*   ⛔ **NO APP SCAFFOLDING**: Do not invoke any external project scaffolding skills (e.g., `uniappx-project-creator`, `flutter-project-creater`, `react-native-project-creater`) and do not run scripts to create codebases.
*   ⛔ **NO CODING**: Do not write Vue/React/HTML code in this flow. This skill is for **Design Generation** only.
*   ⛔ **NO CONFUSION**: A "Stitch Project" is a design workspace, NOT a code repository.
