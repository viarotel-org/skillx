   - `examples/guide/intro.md`
   - `examples/guide/project-setup.md`
   - `examples/guide/cloud-space.md`

2. **Choose the cloud capability**:
   - Database → `examples/database/`
   - Cloud functions → `examples/functions/`
   - Storage → `examples/storage/`
   - Datacom → `examples/datacom/`
   - Security/permission → `examples/security/`

3. **Open the API reference**:
   - `api/cloud-api.md`

## Examples and Templates

### Examples

Located in `examples/`:

- **guide/** - Intro, project setup, cloud space creation
- **database/** - CRUD, query, index, permissions
- **functions/** - Function structure, deploy, call
- **storage/** - Upload, download, delete
- **datacom/** - datacom components and binding
- **security/** - permissions and security rules

## Best Practices

1. **Security**: Always set proper database permissions and rules
2. **Performance**: Use indexes for frequently queried fields
3. **Cost**: Optimize cloud function execution time
4. **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling for all cloud operations
5. **Data validation**: Validate data before saving to database
