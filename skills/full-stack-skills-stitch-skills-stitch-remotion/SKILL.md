# Stitch to Remotion Walkthrough Videos

**Constraint**: Only use this skill when the user explicitly mentions "Stitch" and walkthrough video or Remotion.

You are a **video production specialist** creating walkthrough videos from Stitch app designs. Combine Stitch MCP (or **stitch-mcp-list-projects**, **stitch-mcp-list-screens**, **stitch-mcp-get-screen**) to get screens with Remotion for programmatic video: transitions, zoom, text overlays.

## Prerequisites

- Stitch MCP Server (https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/mcp/guide/)
- Remotion MCP or Remotion CLI; Node.js and npm
- A Stitch project with designed screens

## Retrieval and Networking

1. **Discover prefixes**: Run `list_tools` for Stitch and Remotion MCP prefixes.
2. **Project/screen lookup**: Use `[stitch_prefix]:list_projects` (filter view=owned), then `[stitch_prefix]:list_screens` with projectId; identify screens for the walkthrough.
3. **Screen metadata**: For each screen call `[stitch_prefix]:get_screen`; get `screenshot.downloadUrl`, `htmlCode.downloadUrl`, width, height, title, description.
4. **Asset download**: Download screenshots (e.g. via web_fetch or Bash curl); save to `assets/screens/{screen-name}.png` in walkthrough order.
5. **Manifest**: Create `screens.json` with projectName, screens array (id, title, description, imagePath, width, height, duration).

## Video Composition Strategy

- **ScreenSlide.tsx**: Single screen (imageSrc, title, description, width, height); zoom/fade; configurable duration (e.g. 3–5 s).
- **WalkthroughComposition.tsx**: Sequence of ScreenSlides; transitions (fade/slide from `@remotion/transitions`); text overlays.
- **Config**: Frame rate (e.g. 30 fps), dimensions (match Stitch or scale), total duration.

Use Remotion `spring()` for zoom; use `@remotion/transitions` (fade, slide) between screens.

### Common Patterns (align with official)

- **Simple slide show**: 3–5 s per screen, cross-fade, bottom text overlay (screen title), progress bar at top.
- **Feature highlight**: Zoom into regions; animated circles/arrows; slow-motion on key interactions; before/after comparisons.
- **User flow**: Sequential screens with directional slides; numbered steps overlay; highlight actions (clicks, taps); connect screens with animated paths.

### Optional: Voiceover and dynamic text

- **Voiceover**: Generate script from screen descriptions; use TTS or recorded audio; sync screen timing with narration.
- **Dynamic text**: Download `htmlCode.downloadUrl` per screen; parse HTML for headings/buttons/labels; generate timed callouts in the composition.

## Execution Steps

1. **Gather assets**: List Stitch project → list screens → get_screen for each → download screenshots → build screens.json.
2. **Remotion setup**: Use existing Remotion project or `npm create video@latest -- --blank` in e.g. `video/`; install `@remotion/transitions` etc.
3. **Build components**: ScreenSlide.tsx (useCurrentFrame, spring, zoom/fade); WalkthroughComposition.tsx (Sequence, manifest); update remotion.config.ts.
4. **Preview**: `npm run dev` in video/; adjust timing and transitions.
5. **Render**: `npx remotion render WalkthroughComposition output.mp4` (or use Remotion MCP if available).

## Integration with This Repo

- **Stitch screens**: Use **stitch-mcp-list-projects**, **stitch-mcp-list-screens**, **stitch-mcp-get-screen** to resolve projectId/screenId and get download URLs.
- **Design consistency**: If DESIGN.md exists (from **stitch-design-md**), use screen titles/descriptions for overlay text.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Blurry screenshots | Use full-resolution screenshot URLs |
| Misaligned text | Match composition size to screen dimensions |
| Choppy animations | Increase fps; tune spring damping |
| Build fails | Check Node/Remotion version; install deps |
